### Background

The fight for equal democratic representation emerged from the outstanding work of electoral reform groups before us. Undi Saksama wants to push this fight forward by taking on a youth-centric approach. We believe that there is a need for younger voices in matters relating to electoral reform.

To encourage young voices in the movement for electoral reform, we seek to create democratic spaces where young Malaysian voices are welcomed. The integration of youth voices in the national discussion surrounding electoral reform is in line with Undi 18’s agenda of promoting youth-centric democratic reforms.
